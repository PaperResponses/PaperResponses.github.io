Thank you for your nice comments! Commonly used SGG datasets often have many foreground relationships that are missed, but our proposed active learning framework still treats these relationships as foreground relationships. While this is reasonable, the results of our framework may not be optimal in datasets with missing-label relationships. We will add this limitation to the conclusion in the next version.


Thank you for your heuristic comments.
